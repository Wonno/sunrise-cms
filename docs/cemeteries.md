# Cemeteries

![Update Cemetery View](./images/cemetery-update.png)

Cemeteries are groupings of [burial sites](./burialSites.md).

## Key Cemetery Fields

**Cemetery Key**<br />
Can be prepended to burial site names.

**Parent Cemetery**<br />
Helpful when breaking larger cemeteries into smaller sections.
You may, for example, have a cemetery that includes in-ground graves, a mausoleum,
and an urn garden. For organization, you may create individual child cemeteries
in Sunrise CMS for each section, then relate them together using one parent cemetery.

**Geographic Location**<br />
Used to show the cemetery location on a map.

**Directions of Arrival**<br />
Outlines the directions from which the cemetery can be reached.
Useful to cemetery staff who may be receiving a procession.

**Image**<br />
An SVG image of the cemetery, optionally labelled to allow for burial site highlighting.
